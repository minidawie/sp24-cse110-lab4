1. What was the bug?
    - The bug was that num1 and num2 were strings so when doing addition it was concatonating instead.
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
    - I fixed the bug by typecasting num1 and num2 into an integer using Number()
